JCAMP-DX: The IUPAC standard for spectral data exchange 

JCAMP-DX is the IUPAC standard format family for spectral data exchange. IUPAC assumed responsibility for the JCAMP-DX 
range of scientific standards from the Joint Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical Data (JCAMP) in 1995. Active 
development of JCAMP-DX was halted in 2006 with the prospect of an XML replacement but this did not eventuate. 
Continued usage of the specification has made it a de facto standard for exchange of spectral data and some updates 
have been proposed for existing formats and new standards to cover techniques not yet covered. More information at
